# I gave Hunter a janky site for Christmas.

Hunter sent me a Christmas song every day for 60 days, so I learned how to code in a month and gave him a janky top 25 site for Christmas. This is my first project outside of school, and there's still a bunch of shit I gotta figure out to get better at this dev thing. Feel free to send me feedback on dev best practices, I need it!
